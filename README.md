# stl54321



For my own learning purposes, I'm slowly creating my own STL implementation.  I say, 'learning,'
but really, it's more just so I don't forget my programming abilities.

I've put everything into a different namespace so that I can easily test it's functionality
again exist stl's.



Honestly, I don't recommend anyone use this for their own projects.



If you happen to be looking at my code for whatever reason and happen to see errors or bugs, I would appreceate it if,
rather than submitting pull requests, if you just post an issue with an file and approximate line number where the error
or bug is so I can try to locate and fix it for my self; since this is supposed to be for my own learning..
